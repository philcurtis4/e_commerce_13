# Ecommerce Back-End
## Description
This project was undertaken as part of a coding bootcamp. In this project we are given code for an ecommerce data base using sequelize. We were tasked with creating models that would create tables for us using sequelize. We also had to set up request routes that would perform CRUD for each table. Then using Insomnia demonstrate that each route performs it's intended request.
